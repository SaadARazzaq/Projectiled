# Projectile Motion Simulation 🚀

![](https://github.com/SaadARazzaq/Projectiled/blob/main/output.gif)

This Python script simulates and visualizes the trajectory of a projectile launched at an angle with a given initial velocity. Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering, describing the motion of an object projected into the air, subject only to the force of gravity and air resistance (if applicable).

## How Projectile Motion Works ⚽

Projectile motion is characterized by the following key factors:
- Launch Angle 🚀: The angle at which the projectile is launched from the horizontal.
- Initial Velocity 💨: The initial speed at which the projectile is launched.
- Gravity 🌍: The acceleration due to gravity, which affects the projectile's vertical motion.

The script calculates the projectile's horizontal and vertical positions over time using the equations of motion. It then plots the trajectory on a graph 📈, allowing you to visualize the path of the projectile.

## Examples 📚

Here are some examples of how you can use the simulation:

- Teaching 🎓: Use this simulation to visually demonstrate the concepts of projectile motion in a classroom or educational setting.

- Analysis 📊: Analyze the trajectory of a projectile for various launch conditions and study its characteristics.
